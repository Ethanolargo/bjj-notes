BJJ Notes App

A small mobile app I built for fun using React Native and Expo to log Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training notes.

When you open the app, it asks for your move of the day. You enter a technique, and the app adds it to a journal along with the current date and a short description of the move pulled from a JSON file

I pre-wrote descriptions for common techniques, so the app matches the move name and fills in the details automatically.

This was a personal project I built to practice React Native, data handling, and basic mobile app flow. It’s not meant to be a polished production app.

This is a very small video demo: https://youtube.com/shorts/tw3HPX41Jkc
